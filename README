My assignment for the WYWM python course.

Create knights, choosing their names, armor colours and weapons, with randomly generated health and luck attributes. You can then alter their name, colour and weapon after they are created.
If you make 2 or more knights you can makethem duel each other. They take turns attacking each other, with a chance to miss or hit, then a chance to do a critical hit for double damage, using random generated ints.
